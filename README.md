<p> I was not able to implement correct functionality for PUT and DELETE features, as
I was very overwhelmed with other finals which made me underestimate this assignment. </p>
<p> I think I was on the right track as I implemented authentication and GET and POST methods with Firebase state persistance and database upload functions </p>
<p> I should have taken more time mapping out the CRUD functionality as well as organizing all the event listeners, which cause me a lot of hurt/wasted time in debugging.
